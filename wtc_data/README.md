# WTC Data

This folder contains all of the WTC data we'll be working with. I got most of the data from the [WTC results site](www.wmh-wtc.com). In general, files in this folder ought not be modified unless you really know what you are doing. Work with the files containing the Elo rankings. They can easily be recreated if things go sideways.
