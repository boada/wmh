# Model Data

These files contain descriptions -- mostly name a point cost) for the models in the game of Warmachine and Hordes. I downloaded the data from the [Troop-Creator Repo](https://github.com/boada/troop-creator). I modfied them a bit with `fixJson.py` to get them into a format that I could easily working with pandas. In general, these files should not be modified unless you know what you are doing. 

We'll use these files when we do deep dives into the results from 2017.
